Welcome to my website!

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Real Estate at NUS Business School, National University of Singapore.   
My research interests lie in environmental economics, public economics, and applied microeconomics, with a particular focus on climate change, air pollution, and sustainability. Here is my [CV](../doc/cv.pdf).

You can also connect with me on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DFrjF7QAAAAJ&hl=en), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7847-4244), and [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=3445877).
